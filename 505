The machine is capable of perceiving the state of that environment as a vector of features
The machine can execute actions in every state
Different actions bring different rewards
Actions could also move the machine to another state of the environment

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning where the machine
"lives" in an environment
Semi-Supervised Learning
Embedding method
Machine learning model
Learning task
"I think [???] I am"
Self-supervised = unsupervised + supervised
Meaning
Word embeddings
Tasks (e.g., Classification, Regression)
The dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled examples
Usually, the quantity of unlabeled examples is much higher.
The goal is the same as the goal of the supervised learning algorithm.
Most semi-supervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms
For example
Detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud.
Catching manufacturing defects.
Automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learning algorithm.
The goal is the identification of rare items, events or observations.
Which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.
The goal is to simplify the data without losing too much information.
One way to do this is to merge several correlated features into one.
Clustering is the task of grouping a set of object
In such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).
Training set
Feature 2
For example, a set of customers, a clustering algorithm can group them basec on their similarity

Unsupervised Learning

N The dataset is a collection of unlabeled examples {x}=1
Again, x is a feature vector
The goal is to create a model
The model takes a feature vector x as input
It either transforms the feature vector into another vector or into a value that can be used to solve a practical problem

Support Vector Regression (если считать классификацию отдельной)

Classification:
Goal: Predict a category or class label
Output: Discrete values (e.g., "yes"/"no", "spam"/"not spam", digits 0–9)
Examples:
Email spam detection (spam or not)
Disease diagnosis (positive or negative)
Image recognition (cat, dog, car, etc.)

Regression:
Goal: Predict a numerical value
Output: Continuous values (real numbers)
Examples:
Predicting house prices
Forecasting temperature
Value

Quantitative and Qualitative variables
Quantitative variables take on numerical values
Examples include a person's age or income
Qualitative variables take on values in one of C different classes, or categories
E.g., a cancer diagnosis (yes or no
Regression - Refers to problems with a quantitative target label
Classification - Refers to problems with a qualitative target label

Supervised Learning: Classification - Regression

Dataset notation:

𝑁={(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖)}=𝑁𝑖=1— our dataset (table)
𝑁=4 is the total number of data points (rows)
D=3 — total number of features (columns, excluding the target label column)

𝑋1 - is the first feature vector
𝑥3  — third feature of the second feature vector 
𝑦3 — target label of the third feature vector

Example features (for a housing dataset):
Rooms|Area|District|Price (target label)

Supervised Learning
The goal is to use the dataset to produce a model
The model takes a feature vector x as input
It outputs information that allows deducing the label y for this feature vector
The dataset is the collection of labeled examples {(xi, Yi)}=1
Each element x₁ among N is called a feature vectorA feature vector is a vector in which each dimension j = 1, ..., D contains a value that describes the example somehow
That value is called a feature and is denoted as x) (x superscript j)
The label y₁ can be either an element belonging to a finite set of classes {1, 2,..., C}, or a real number, or a more complex structure
Like a vector, a matrix, a tree, or a graph

| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **When is data available?**    | All data is available up front                | Data arrives sequentially over time                               |
| **How is the model trained?**  | Trained once on a full dataset                | Updated continuously with each new data point                     |
| **When is the model updated?** | Only when retrained (offline)                 | After every observation (real-time)                               |
| **Ideal use case**             | Static environments (e.g., medical diagnosis) | Dynamic environments (e.g., stock prices, recommendation systems) |

Batch Learning
Batch learning involves training a model on a the entire dataset, and then used to make predictions on new data.
Batch learning is commonly used in situations where the dataset is relatively small and can be processed quickly.
If you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of spam), you need to:
First, train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset (Not just the new data, but also the old data)->
Then, stop the old system and replace it with the new one

Online learning
Online learning, also known as incremental learning or streaming learning, involves training a model on new data as it arrives, one observation at a time.
The model is updated each time a new observation is received, allowing it to adapt to changes in the data over time.
Online learning is commonly used in situations where the data is too large to be processed all at once, or where the data is constantly changing, such as in stock market data or social media data.

Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning
| **Perspective**                   | **Instance-Based Learning**                      | **Model-Based Learning**                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **How is knowledge stored?**      | Keeps the training data (instances)              | Learns a general model from the data               |
| **How does it make predictions?** | By comparing new input to stored examples        | By applying a learned function or parameters       |
| **When does learning happen?**    | Mostly at prediction time (lazy learning)        | During training phase (eager learning)             |
| **Examples**                      | k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Case-Based Reasoning | Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks |

Idea: "Remember and compare."
It keeps all the examples and looks at the most similar ones when making a prediction.
Example: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
vs
Idea: "Learn a pattern."
It creates a model from the training data and uses it to predict new results.
Examples: Linear Regression, Neural Networks

Parametric and Nonparametric Algorithms
What Parametric Algorithms do: Assume the data follows a known shape (like a straight line).
They learn: A fixed number of parameters (e.g., slope & intercept in a line).
Fast to train, but less flexible.
Examples:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
vs
What Nonparametric Algorithms do: Don't assume a fixed shape or number of parameters.
They learn patterns freely from the data, even if it's complex.
More flexible, but need more data.
Examples:
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (with kernels)

Параметры (parameters) — это веса модели, которые она сама подбирает во время обучения.
Гиперпараметры (hyperparameters) — это настройки, которые задаёт человек до обучения (например, количество слоёв, скорость обучения).
Parameters
Are variables that define the model
Are directly modified by the learning algorithm based on the training data
The goal of learning is to find such values of parameters that make the model optimal in a certain sense
Hyperparameters
Are properties of a learning algorithm, usually having a numerical value
Influence the way the algorithm works
Are not learned by the algorithm itself from data
They have to be set by the data analyst before running the algorithm.

Evalustion - Measuring the Quality of Fit
We need some way to measure how well its predictions actually match the observed data
To evaluate the performance of a statistical learning method on a given data set
The most commonly-used measure
For regression is the mean squared error (MSE)
For classification is the accuracy

| **Metric**                   | **Use For**    | **Goal**                     | **Formula Meaning**                              | **Formula**                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** | Regression     | Minimize error               | Penalizes squared differences                    | $\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - f(x_i))^2$     |
| **Accuracy**                 | Classification | Maximize correct predictions | Measures match between true and predicted labels | $\text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} 1(y_i = f(x_i))$ |
MSE (Среднеквадратичная ошибка)
Используется для регрессии (когда мы предсказываем число).
Смысл: чем меньше MSE, тем лучше модель.
Она сильно штрафует большие ошибки, то есть если модель промахнулась далеко, это заметно ухудшает результат.
Accuracy (Точность)
Используется для классификации (когда мы предсказываем класс, например «да/нет»).
Смысл: показывает, какая доля предсказаний совпала с правильными ответами.
Чем ближе к 100%, тем лучше модель.

Training Set vs Test Set
Training set | Validation Test Set | Test Set
Train on training set, tune on validation, report on testset
This avoids overfitting ('tuning to the test set')
More conservative estimate of performance

Underfitting
Your model is underfitting the training data when the model performs poorly on the training data. This is because the model is unable to capture the relationship between the input examples and the target values.
Overfitting
Your model is overfitting your training data when you see that the model performs well on the training data but does not perform well on the evaluation data. This is because the model is memorizing the data it has seen and is unable to generalize to unseen examples.
Add More Training Data – More data helps the model generalize better.
Use Regularization (L1/L2, Dropout)
L1/L2 Regularization (Ridge/Lasso) adds a penalty to large weights.
Dropout (for neural networks) randomly deactivates neurons during training.
Early Stopping - Stop training when validation loss stops improving.
Reduce Model Complexity - Decrease the number of layers, neurons, or use a simpler algorithm.
Use Data Augmentation - Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping (for images), or synonyms and paraphrasing (for text).
Cross-Validation - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
Hyperparameter Tuning – Adjust parameters like learning rate, batch size, number of trees (for decision trees), etc.
But paradox: want as much data as possible for training, and as much for validation; how to split?

Cross-validation:
K-folds (K-Fold Cross-validation In cross-validation, we choose a number k, and partition our data into k disjoint subsets called folds.)
Bootstrapping
Hold-out
Leave-one-out
Leave-p-out
Stratified K-folds
Repeated K-folds
Nested K-folds
Complete

Training error
-The MSE/accuracy can be computed using the training data that was used to fit the model
-It is referred to as the training MSE (or accuracy)
Test error
-Rather, we are interested in the correctness of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen test data
-It is referred to as the test MSE/accuracy
We want to choose the method that gives the lowest test MSE (or highest test accuracy)

How do you turn a real-world business problem into a machine learning task?
Why should data be split into training and test sets at the very beginning of a project?
What is the difference between i.i.d. datasets and time series datasets, and why does it matter for data splitting?
What are common issues in raw data (e.g., missing values, outliers, imbalanced classes) that must be addressed before modeling?

You turn a real-world business problem into a machine learning task by translating the goal into a clear prediction or decision that an algorithm can learn from data.
Steps:
Understand the goal: Identify what the business wants to achieve (We need to predict whether a particular customer will stay with us).
Define the prediction target: Decide what you are trying to predict (e.g., churn = Yes/No).

You turn a real-world business problem into a machine learning task by translating the goal into a clear prediction or decision that an algorithm can learn from data.
Steps:
Choose the task type: Frame it as a classification, regression, or other ML task based on the target:
Classification → predicting categories (e.g., churn or not).
Regression → predicting a continuous value (e.g., sales amount).
Identify available data – Gather data that links inputs (features) to the target.
